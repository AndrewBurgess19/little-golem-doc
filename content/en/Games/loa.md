## Rules 

Lines of Action (or LOA) is an abstract strategy board game for two players invented by Claude Soucie. 
The objective is to connect all of one's pieces into a single group. 
The game was recommended by the Spiel des Jahres in 1988.

The object of the game is to bring all of one's pieces together into a contiguous body so that they are connected vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

Movement

- Players alternate moves, with Black having the first move.
- Pieces move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- A piece moves exactly as many spaces as there are pieces (both friendly and enemy) on the line in which it is moving.
- A piece may not jump over an enemy piece.
- A piece may jump over friendly pieces. 
- A piece may land on a square occupied by an enemy piece, resulting in the latter's capture and removal from the game.
- A player who is reduced to a single piece wins the game, because his pieces are by definition united. If a move results, due to a capture, in each player having all his pieces in a contiguous body, then either the player moving wins, or the game is **a draw**.
