Conhex is a 2-player abstract game in which the winner is the first player to connect his or her assigned sides of a square board (thus the goal is similar to the goal in Twixt.) The board is a pattern of non-regular hexagons with a few non-hexagonal polygons. Players alternate turns placing pieces of their own color on a vertex, and a player can claim a space after placing pieces on at least half the vertices of that space.
