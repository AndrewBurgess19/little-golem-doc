## Rules

Breakthrough was originally played on a 7×7 board
with 14 pieces per player; however, since it won the
2001 8×8 Game Design Competition sponsored by the
Abstract Games Magazine and the Strategy Gaming
Society, the 8×8 version with 16 pieces per player is
considered standard. Advanced players might enjoy the
more complex 10×10 version with 30 pieces per player.
The standard game starts with the first two rows in
front of each player filled with his pieces (see the figure).
Players alternate moving one of their own pieces per
turn, trying to reach the opposite side of the board.
The first player to do so will be declared the winner.

A piece can move forward or diagonally forward to an
adjacent empty cell. Alternatively, it can capture an
enemy piece diagonally forward (as chess pawns do).
Captures are neither compulsory nor can be chained.
In the figure, piece **1** can move freely, whereas piece **2**
has two of their three possible moves blocked by friendly
pieces. Piece **3** can move directly forward or capture
any of the enemy pieces, whereas piece **4** can capture
or move diagonally but is unable to move forward.
Note that White’s pieces move and capture in the opposite direction.
